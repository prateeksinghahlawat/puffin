This page covers the different type of platform apps available for you to choose, Package to subscribe, understanding the difference between them and Why you need to consider each of these solutions. 

## TradlyPlatform - Android Only 
(Comes under Lite Package, starting just from $99 per month)
Android Apps, apps that are build using Google android operating system. It can be used on all devices with the Android operating system (something like the Windows operating system)
TradlyPlatform Android version can run as 
- Simple mobile app
- Tablet App
- Embedded in IoT Devices
- Kiosk, POS Devices. 

Our first and robust product is our Android app, where all our features are first tested and launched. If one is looking to validate their idea without taking too much risk, launching the android the only version is the faster and more efficient, especially with simple Google play store procedures & policies. 

## TradlyPlatform - WebApp Only 
A web app is technically a website, but it's not just a simple website. It's more like an application that looks like a website with advanced app-like modular features  + customisable in the next six months. 

One of our unique approaches to building products is to become part of our users' lifestyle and our client's users. TradlyPlatform believes apps can be closer to a user life than a simple website. An app can provide more profound use cases like location, notifications, chats, etc. So apps can be more effective than a simple website in most use cases. 

Hence our web app is considered as addon to our existing stack & not an independent solution. So you may not be able to customise the web app features extensively. But this could be an additional channel of traffic.

## TradlyPlatform - Full Package
The full package solution comprises the Android mobile app, iOS mobile app, web app, and superadmin dashboard access. 

## TradlyPlatform - SuperAdmin Panel
A SuperAdmin Dashboard is the platform owners dashboard, one with a more straightforward interface for monitoring platform performance, configure the platform information & more.
- Typically, most of these configurations are done by developers & are hardcoded. 
- To empower the non-technical platform owners + making fast actions, you can use the SuperAdmin Dashboard to achieve partial configurations of the platform features. 
- We will be expanding what you can do with this dashboard with features like direct app customisation, & more.

## TradlyPlatform API - Headless 
Tradly API is API-FIRST headless commerce platform which will provide backend business logic and system to start tech developers to build front apps on top of it. 

Front end apps have some crucial features, including but not limited to, Mobile Apps, web apps, POS, Kiosk, Digital Boards, etc.

### Why did we start Tradly API? 
As a platform thinking company, we need to be open ourself. Creativity is everywhere, and it is powerful if we harness them. There are great people out there who can build different use cases on top of our core API, so we want to open our API. 

Also, the type and number of devices/displays are getting exposed to users is increasing. The world has changed from a single device to multiple devices (Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Smartwatch, etc.). And it doesn't seem to be stopping with 5G and IoT penetration. 

If you want to build a future solution, you need all these capabilities and are working towards that. 

:::important
At any point in time, whether you are using our full package or ala carte solution, one can use our API to build a product for many use-cases. That's how versatile the TradlyPlatform Ecosystem is.
